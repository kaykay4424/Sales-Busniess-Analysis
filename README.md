Reasons for their performance differences,

**TOP-PERFORMING CATEGORY : Clothing(Reason for Top performance):**

- Clothing performs strongly because it includes high demand apparel items such as Sarees, Kurtis, and Trousers, which consistently generate significant sales across both online and retail channels.
- Repeat purchases and seasonal demand cycles (festivals, weddings, and cultural events) contribute to a stable and recurring revenue stream.
- Accessories within clothing (like scarves and stoles) also drive complementary sales, boosting the overall profit margin.
-This combination of high individual product demand, recurring seasonal purchases, and cross product sales makes Clothing the top performing category overall.

*Talking about Trousers being the Top-performing Sub category of Clothing,*

- Pricing is moderate, making them accessible to a wider customer base compared to high-cost clothing items, which helps maintain a healthy profit margin.
- Trousers perform strongly due to consistent year-round demand for everyday wear, both in casual and formal segments.

**UNDERPERFORMING CATEGORY : Furniture(Reason for Underperformance):**

- Furniture underperforms because it consists of high-cost, bulky items that require more consideration before purchase. Customers often delay buying due to space
  constraints, shipping difficulties, and seasonal demand fluctuations.
- Unlike apparel or electronics, furniture items do not require frequent replacement, reducing recurring sales opportunities.
- Additionally, the rise of compact or multifunctional furniture has shifted demand away from traditional tables and bookcases, further limiting sales volume.
- These factors combined — high cost, low replacement frequency, and changing customer preferences — result in lower sales and profit margins, making Furniture the
  underperforming category.

*Talking about the tables being most underperfroming Sub Category of Furniture,*

- Tables underperform because they are high cost, bulky items that require more consideration before purchase.
- Customers often delay buying tables due to space constraints, shipping costs, and seasonal demand fluctuations.
- Moreover, tables do not require frequent replacement, and the rise of compact or multifunctional furniture has reduced demand for traditional tables, leading to
  lower sales volume and profit margin.

OBSERVATION-

(Since the first part of the analysis focuses on the Furniture category, the trend and strategy analysis below also pertain to Furniture.) *

- Examining the month-over-month percentage change in target sales reveals that most months show stable and incremental growth. Keeping out threshold at 5% and
  treating a spike/dip of 5% or more as significant, We find out that April stands out as the month with significant target fluctuations.

- April shows a Dip of 11.864%. (From increase of 1.72% in March to drop of 11.86% in April).

**Strategies for aligning target expectations with actual performance trends:**

- With people buying furniture in early months of year due to winter sales and discounts. Implement discounts or combo offers in historically weak months (like
  April) to maintain consistent sales momentum and reduce volatility.

- Furniture sales often follow predictable seasonal patterns, with certain months naturally slower than other, thus adjust future targets realistically for such
  months.

- Furniture purchases are strongly linked to external factors like home sales and household renovation activity. Hence a small decline in real-estate market can
  also be the reason for dip.
