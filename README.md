Reasons for their performance differences,

**TOP-PERFORMING CATEGORY : Clothing(Reason for Top performance):**

- Clothing performs strongly because it includes high demand apparel items such as Sarees, Kurtis, and Trousers, which consistently generate significant sales across both online and retail channels.
- Repeat purchases and seasonal demand cycles (festivals, weddings, and cultural events) contribute to a stable and recurring revenue stream.
- Accessories within clothing (like scarves and stoles) also drive complementary sales, boosting the overall profit margin.
-This combination of high individual product demand, recurring seasonal purchases, and cross product sales makes Clothing the top performing category overall.

- Pricing is moderate, making them accessible to a wider customer base compared to high-cost clothing items, which helps maintain a healthy profit margin.
- Trousers perform strongly due to consistent year-round demand for everyday wear, both in casual and formal segments.
